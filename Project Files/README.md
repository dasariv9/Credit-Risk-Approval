The system includes:

End-to-end ML pipeline (preprocessing + model training)

Random Forest classifier with strong performance

Human-friendly, step-by-step Streamlit UI

Real-time approval prediction with probability

Feature importance visualization

Extendable framework for dashboards & AI summaries
